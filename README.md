# AutoBot

AutoBot is a basic google hangouts chat bot template, which can be modified as per  one's needs.

The current project is developed under the concept of 'Gamification' for taking inputs from the users and saving them in 'Google Sheets'.

Gamification, to simply put, is implementing game principles in non-gaming environment to motivate participation, engagement, and loyalty. Please notice that the bot is not a Machine Learning bot. It is a simple bot mainly used for taking inputs and sending push notifications to the people who added the bot.
